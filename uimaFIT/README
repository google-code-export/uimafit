SUMMARY
#######
uimaFIT is a library that provides factories, injection, and testing utilities for UIMA.  The following list 
highlights some of the features uimaFIT provides:

 * Factories: simplify instantiating UIMA components programmatically without descriptor files.  
 	For example, to instantiate an AnalysisEngine a call like this could be made: 
 	AnalysisEngineFactory.createPrimitive(MyAEImpl.class, myTypeSystem, paramName, paramValue)
 * Injection: handles the binding of configuration parameter values to the corresponding member variables 
 	in the analysis engines and handles the binding of external resources.  For example, to bind a configuration 
 	parameter just annotate a member variable with @ConfigurationParameter.  Then add one line of code to 
 	your initialize method - ConfigurationParameterInitializer.initialize(this, uimaContext).  This is handled 
 	automatically if you extend the uimaFIT JCasAnnotator_ImplBase class.
 * Testing: uimaFIT simplifies testing in a number of ways described in the documentation.  By making it 
 	easy to instantiate your components without descriptor files a large amount of difficult-to-maintain and 
 	unnecessary XML can be eliminated from your test code.   This makes tests easier to write and maintain.  
 	Also, running components as a pipeline can be accomplished with a method call like this:  
 	SimplePipeline.runPipeline(reader, ae1, ..., aeN, consumer1, ... consumerN)

uimaFIT requires Java 1.5 or higher and UIMA 2.3.0 or higher.
